DAoE: Dark Age of Exiles
========
based on the Dawn of Light - Dark Age of Camelot Server Emulator (DOL)

City of Heroes meets Path of Exiles
----

I'm using DOL as the server implementation of a more exciting game.

To do this, I've gutted most DAoC specific mechanisms from the DOL core. It compiles so far, but is untested.
